    - queue                 #pip install queuelib
    - PIL                   #pip install Pillow
    - numpy                 #pip install numpy
    - random                #pip install random2
    - cv2                   #pip install opencv-python
    - typing                #pip install typing
    - time                  #pip install times
    - os                    #pip install os-sys
    - functools             #pip install functools

To generate and solve the maze with dijkstra execute the following command:
